f(R) gravity theories
For f(R) theories of gravity, the relevant MTG coefficients for the class of k=0 solutions are saved in the file “MTGcfRk0.mx”. They are imported in the notebook “MTGcfRk0.nb” and used to evaluate the constraints.

Fourth-order gravity theories
For fourth-order gravity theories, the relevant MTG coefficients for the class of k=0 solutions are saved in the file “MTGc4OGk0.mx”. They are imported in the notebook “MTGc4OGk0.nb” and used to evaluate the constraints.

Explicit expressions for the MTG coefficients of the extreme-valued k=1 solution are considerably shorter and are thus provided in the article itself for both f(R) and fourth-order gravity theories.
